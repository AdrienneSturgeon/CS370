# CS370

# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself? 

I was able to solve the challenge of creating an intelligent agent that utilized a Deep Neural Network to find the solution to a treasure hunting maze. I was given starter code which contained the necessary dependencies and framework for implementing the agent's logic. I primarily developed the code behind the agent's reinforcement learning process and its supporting nueral network. 

# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science: #What do computer scientists do and why does it matter? 

Computer Scientists provide primarily software-based solutions to the problems that exist within a variety of fields. The code written and supported by Computer Scientists provides the script by which technology-based solutions operate. The software tools used by Computer Scientists are dedicated to improving the every day life of users or by solving commercial and industrial problems with increased efficiency of computer systems. Automation is a major driver behind many of these solutions. This often requires implementation of algorithms that benefit from the concepts taught in this course.

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist? 

I approach problems by breaking them down into their components and using deductive reasoning to determine a solution. An understanding of the problem is gained, then its use cases and potential risks are analyzed. After this, a solution is created which prioritizes efficiency and portability. This often follows the principles of object-oriented programming. 

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization? 

The ethical responsibilities that I uphold are primarly based on the security of customer data, and the impact of the software that I create. Both of these must be considered, because Computer Scientists work in increasingly important user data with large reaching impact. In fact, entire teams may be dedicated to these concepts alone. Members of these teams have the responsibility of creating software solutions for and informing users and companies about data security and the impact of associated programs. We must also follow all regulations legally relevant to potential problems.
